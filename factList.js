  "the James Webb Space Telescope weighs nearly 13,700 pounds.";
  "the primary mirror is over 21 feet in diameter";
  "the sunshield is approximately 69.5 ft by 46.5 ft (almost the size of a tennis court!)";
  "the telescope is designed to help astronomers comprehend the formation of galaxies throughout billions of years using infrared light";
  "Webb can see through dust clouds (where planetary systems and stars are formed) and studies atmospheres of other planets.";
  "it orbits the Sun at a point located a milion miles (1.5 million km) from Earth known as the second Lagrange point (reffered to as L2).";
  "the telescope was launched on december 25, 2021";
  "the James Webb telescope project began construction in 2004.";
  "the Webb mission is intended to last for 5.5 to 10 years.";
  "the project is a collaboration between NASA, the European Space Agency (ESA), and the Canadian Space Agency.";
  "the telescope is designed to observe stars and galaxies that formed over 13.5 billion years ago.";
  "one of the main goals for the project is to study scientific mysteries revolving around the origins of the universe and where humans belong in it.";
  "Webb can observe exoplanetary atmospheres (planets that orbit other stars) and learn about their chemical compositions through a technique known as transmission spectroscopy.";
  "the 18 mirrors of the Webb telescope are beryllium and gold-plated hexagonal shapes";
  "it is the largest and most powerful space science telescope created by NASA";
  "the building of the James Webb Space Telescope involved thousands of scientists and engineers from 29 U.S. states, 14 countries, and over 300 universities.";
  "the Webb telescope is 100 times more powerful than the Hubble.";
  "to protect the telescope from infrared radiation of the Sun, Earth, and Moon, the telescope has a 5-layer sunshield that equivalent to using SPF 1 million";
  "Webb is the largest telescope in space";
  "the telescope weighs approximately 6200 kilograms";
  "the primary mirror weighs nearly 705 kilograms";
  "the telescope's focal length (how much light is converged) is 131.4 meters";
  "the Webb telescope operates at a temperature of -370°F (under 50 Kelvin)";
  "there is a difference of approximately 625°F between the max temperature of the first telescope layer and the minimum temperature of the 5th (last) layer.";
  "the main instruments used to operate the Webb telescope are the near infrared camera (NIRCam), near infrared spectrograph (NIRSpec), the mid infrared instrument (MIRI), and the fine guidance sensors/near infrared imager and slitless spectrograph (FGS/NIRISS).";
  "the building of the James Webb space telescope led to many major innovations in space technology including deployable sunshields, folding segmented mirrors, detectors, micro-shutters, mirror control, and lightweight optics.";
  "the telescope can be abbreviated as "JWST" or "Webb"";
