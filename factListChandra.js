    "the observatory is managed by the Marshall Center at NASA Headquarters in D.C.",
    "Chandra was designed to help scientists understand the origin and evolution of our universe by using x-rays to observe hot regions of space with high magnetic fields where charge particles could collide",
    "Chandra was launched on July 23, 1999",
    "considered to be a great innovation in x-ray astronomy technology",
    "Is known to be the world's most powerful x-ray telescope with 8x greater resolution than previous x-ray telescopes by detecting sources 20x fainter",
    "it is 200 times higher in orbit than the Hubble, traveling 1/3 the way to the moon in each orbit.",
    "Chandra is able to observe x-rays from gas clouds that take over 5 million light years to travel through.",
    "The x-rays of the Chandra observatory can study particles of black holes.",
    "The Chandra Observatory is approximately 1 billion times more powerful than the first X-ray telescope (which was released in 1963)",
    "Chandra primarily studies flaring stars, exploding stars, black holes, and enormous clouds of hot gas located in galaxy clusters #womeninstem",
